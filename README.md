# ACLr8

ACLr8 is a Python script that will check your hard drive for the files that cause the "ACL found but not expected" errors in Disk Utility, and remove all ACL from them.

Although these errors are relatively harmless, they can be quite annoying and they can cause permission repairs to take much longer than they should (several hours in some cases).

## Instructions

1. Run the program by double-clicking it.
2. Enter your password if asked (it is normal for nothing to appear while you type).
3. There is no step 3.
